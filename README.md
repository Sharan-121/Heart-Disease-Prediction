## Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Techniques

## Problem Definition
* Given a Medical Dataset,predict whether a person has Heart Disease or not.
* The dataset comprises of 14 Columns including the Target variable(0 or 1).

## Data
* The Dataset is available in the following Kaggle link (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

## Scores
* Three models(Random Forest Classifier,Logistic Regressor,K Nearest Neighbors) were trained and tested on the Dataset.
* After Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV,Logistic Regressor outperformed the other models with an Accuracy of 88 percentage.
